h1. Turntable API for Scala

This is an incomplete version of the Turntable API as originally developed by "Alain Gilbert":https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API.

It can (or, at least, will eventually) be useful for making bots on Turntable.

Example usage:    
    
bc.. 
    import net.liftweb.json.JsonAST._
    object Main {
      def main(args: Array[String]) {
          // obtain these values using Alain Gilbert's bookmarklet:
          // http://alaingilbert.github.com/Turntable-API/bookmarklet.html
          val auth = "xxxx"
          val userId = "xxxx"
          val bot = new com.metatrope.turntable.Bot(auth, userId)
  
          bot.changeRoom("4df1058699968e6b8a00168d") // go to the turntable.fm/industrial room
  
          // let's confirm that we are now, in fact, in the industrial room we tried
          // to join
          val room = bot.roomInfo
          println("Currently in room: " + room.name)
  
          // see what they're playing
          val song = bot.roomInfo.currentSong
          println("Currently playing: " + song.name + " (" + song.id + ")")
 
          // add a listener to listen in on chat
          bot.listen({x=> println(x.name + " = " + x.text)})
          
          // join the conversation
          bot.speak("VNV Nation is awesome!")
      }
    }
